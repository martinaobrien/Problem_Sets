Introduction to Programming and Scripting Problem set designed to develop programmes usings python programming language. 

# List of Problem Sets

    Problem Set 1 sumupto.py

This problem set seeks to calculate the sum of all the numbers between one and an inputted by the user. 

~ Key points
Input variable is needed for calculation

Ensure that value of inputted number is positive by including the syntax ==0

While loop was inserted, the programme kept looping in the while loop as long as the argument is true

Indentation is key expecially as the print function is not part of the previous statement and programme will continue to learn as it will not view the loop as being complete and the argument as false

    Problem Set 2 begins-with-t.py
This programme outputs whether today is a day that starts with a T. This programme using an 'if' and 'else' statement to determine this using the datetime function.



Import 'datetime' function to enable the programme to work with dates as date objects as this is not innate.

Use of "if" and "else" statement to determine whether or not the statement is true

    Problem Set 3 python divisors.py
This programme prints all the numbers between two integers that are divisible by 6 but not 12

This problem uses a for loop statement to go through a number of interations as the programme has to consider all integers between to two inputted numbers.

Only true statements are printed out in a list format. 

    Problem Set 4: collatz.py 
This programme looks to initial the Collatz Conjecture that requires calculation on the number inputted at numerous stages until the value becomes one. 

This program calls the def (collatz) function to collate and list the outputs generated from the calculations completed throughout the programme in the the inputted number is values at 1

The return statement is also used the return the value in the if and elif loops.

    Problem Set 5 primes.py
This problem uses a control flow that executes a code block that meets certain conditions to identify whether or not the number the user inputs is a prime number.

This problem uses a control flow that executes a code block that meets certain conditions. 

The statements must be nested in order to be executed sequentially

    Problem Set 6 secondstring.py
This problem takes a user input string and outputs every second word. The user can input its own text and the program returns every second word.

This problem used try and except to control the flow of user input and catch any errors to ensure a positive integer input

This problem alsoas incorporated floating point numbers float (num)

    Problem Set 7 squareroot.py

This problem used try and except to control the flow of user input and catch any errors to ensure a positive integer input

This problem alsoas incorporated floating point numbers float (num)

    Problem Set 8 datetime.py
This program outputs the today's date and time in a specific format

This problem used try and except to control the flow of user input and catch any errors to ensure a positive integer input

This problem alsoas incorporated floating point numbers float (num)

    Problem Set 9 second.py moby-dick.txt
A program that reads a text file from a filename on the command line and outputs every second line

Functions used are open to open a text file and readlines to read the content






function plots.py

# Key Learning from the Problem Set
Problem Set 1: 


Problem Set 2:
e

Problem Set 3: 
This problem uses a for loop statement to go through a number of interations as the programme has to consider all integers between to two inputted numbers. Only true statements are printed out in a list format. 

Problem Set 4:
This program calls the def (collatz) function to collate and list the outputs generated from the calculations completed throughout the programme in the the inputted number is values at 1
The return statement is also used the return the value in the if and elif loops. 

Problem Set 5: 
This problem uses a control flow that executes a code block that meets certain conditions. 
The statements must be nested in order to be executed sequentially

Problem Set 6: 
This problem looks at dissecting strings of texts using the the string.split function. 
Additional functions must be executed such as ''.join and the use of list brackets []. 

Problem Set 7:
This problem used try and except to control the flow of user input and catch any errors to ensure a positive integer input
This problem alsoas incorporated floating point numbers float (num)


Problem Set 8: 
The problem imports the module datetime and using specific striftime coding, the program outputs today's date and time in a specific format. 
The use of strftime method returns a string of date and time using the datetime object 
The use of .get enables an output if the other statements are false rather that outputting an error message
