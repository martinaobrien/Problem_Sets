# Problem_Sets
# Submission of Problems Sets as part of my completion of a Higher Diploma in Data Analytics with Galway Mayo Institute of Technology (GMIT) 
# Submission Date 31st of March, 2019

Introduction to Programming and Scripting Problem set designed to develop programmes usings python programming language. 

#List of Problem Sets

Problem Set 1 sumupto.py

This problem set seeks to calculate the sum of all the numbers between one and an inputted by the user. 

Problem Set 2 begins-with-t.py
This programme outputs whether today is a day that starts with a T. This programme using an 'if' and 'else' statement to determine this using the datetime function.

Problem Set 3 python divisors.py
This programme prints all the numbers between two integers that are divisible by 6 but not 12

collatz.py

priimes.py

secondstring.py

squareroot.py

datetime.py

# Key Learning from the Problem Set
Problem Set 1: 
Input variable is needed for calculation
Ensure that value of inputted number is positive by including the syntax ==0. 
While loop was inseted, the programme kept looping in the while loop as long as the argument is true
Indentation is key expecially as the print function is not part of the previous statement and programme will continue to learn as it will not view the loop as being complete and the argument as false

Problem Set 2:
Import 'datetime' function to enable the programme to work with dates as date objects as this is not innate.
Use of "if" and "else" statement to determine whether or not the statement is true

Problem Set 3: 
This problem uses a for loop statement to go through a number of interations as the programme has to consider all integers between to two inputted numbers. Only true statements are printed out in a list format.
